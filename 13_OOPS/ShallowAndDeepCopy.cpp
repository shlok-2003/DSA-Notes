    // changed for all the data members
    // Definition of Shallow copy is
    /* 
    In shallow copy, an object is created by simply copying the data of all variables of the original object. This works well if none 
    of the variables of the object are defined in the heap section of memory. If some variables are dynamically allocated memory from 
    heap section, then the copied object variable will also reference the same memory location. This will create ambiguity and run-time 
    errors, dangling pointer. Since both objects will reference to the same memory location, then change made by one will reflect those
    change in another object as well. Since we wanted to create a replica of the object, this purpose will not be filled by Shallow copy.

    // Definition of Deep copy is
    /*
    In Deep copy, an object is created by copying data of all variables, and it also allocates similar memory resources with the same
    value to the object. In order to perform Deep copy, we need to explicitly define the copy constructor and assign dynamic memory as 
    well, if required. Also, it is required to dynamically allocate memory to the variables in the other constructors, as well.
