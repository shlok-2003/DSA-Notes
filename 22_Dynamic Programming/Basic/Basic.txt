Memoization: In Memoization, we tend to store the values of sub-problems in some map/tables.

Recursion is top-down approach and Dynamic Programming is bottom-up approach.

Tabulation: In Tabulation, we store the value of the previous sub-problems in a bottom-up manner and solve the problem iteratively.
            This means that we start from smaller problems and then with that we solve the bigger problem.
            For example, in Fibonacci numbers we first calculate fib(n) => fib(n-1) & fib(n-2) => fib((n-1) - 1) & fib((n-2) - 2) and so on.
            But in Tabulation, we initialize dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1, then with that, we run a loop and compute the Fibonacci numbers iteratively.
            Thus, we build the solution of the bigger problems from the smaller ones.
