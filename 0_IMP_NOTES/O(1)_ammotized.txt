Why is the amortized insertion runtime O 1?
We say that the insertion operation has O(1) 
amortized run time because the time required to 
insert an element is O(1) on average, even though 
some elements trigger a lengthy rehashing of all the 
elements of the hash table. It is crucial that the array 
size grow geometrically (doubling).
